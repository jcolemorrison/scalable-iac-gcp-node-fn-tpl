# Scaling Infrastructure as Code on Google Cloud Platform

The Google Cloud Platform facing cloud infrastructure demo code for the Google Next '24 talk "Scaling Infrastructure as Code: Proven Strategies and Productive Workflows".  

This is the repo used as a template repository in the no-code module and Waypoint workflow for a Google Function.

When the template is used, it will overwrite this README with its own.

It also has a base github actions workflow to seed an initial function for usage when launching the Google Function.  This is required for bootstrapping functions for the first time.
